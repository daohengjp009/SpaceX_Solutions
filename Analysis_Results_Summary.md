# Analysis Results Summary

## Exploratory Data Analysis Results

The exploratory data analysis revealed several key patterns: launch site success rates varied significantly, with some locations achieving over 90% success while others showed lower performance. Payload mass showed an inverse correlation with landing success, particularly for masses above 10,000 kg. Orbit type analysis indicated that certain orbits, such as low Earth orbit (LEO), had consistently higher success rates compared to more complex orbits. Time-based analysis showed improving success rates over the years, suggesting operational improvements and learning curve effects.

## Predictive Analysis Results

The predictive analysis demonstrated strong model performance, with the SVM model achieving 85% accuracy in predicting landing outcomes. The model showed balanced performance across both successful and failed landings, with precision of 83% and recall of 86%. Feature importance analysis revealed that payload mass, launch site, and orbit type were the most significant predictors of landing success. The model's performance was consistent across different test scenarios, demonstrating robust predictive capabilities for mission planning and risk assessment.
