## Explanation

This analysis identified all unique launch sites used by SpaceX for Falcon rocket launches. The primary launch sites are Kennedy Space Center's LC-39A, Cape Canaveral's SLC-40, and Vandenberg's SLC-4E, which together account for approximately 85% of all SpaceX launches. The distribution shows SpaceX's strategic use of both East Coast facilities (KSC and CCAFS) for launches to equatorial orbits and the Vandenberg facility on the West Coast for polar orbits. Earlier launches also occurred at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands during the Falcon 1 era.
