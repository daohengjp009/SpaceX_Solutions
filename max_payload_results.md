## Explanation

This analysis identifies the SpaceX boosters that have carried the maximum payload mass to orbit. The Falcon 9 Block 5 boosters have demonstrated the highest payload capacity, with the most massive payloads being carried on Starlink missions and high-energy geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) missions.

SpaceX has continuously improved the Falcon 9's payload capacity through several design iterations. The Falcon 9 Block 5, which represents the final version of the Falcon 9, offers the highest performance and can deliver up to 22,800 kg to low Earth orbit (LEO) and 8,300 kg to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).

The payload mass a rocket can carry depends on several factors including the target orbit, whether the booster is recovered, and specific mission requirements. These record-setting missions demonstrate the Falcon 9's capabilities at the upper end of its performance envelope.
