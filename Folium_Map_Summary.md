# Folium Map Visualization Summary

We created an interactive Folium map to visualize SpaceX launch and landing sites, adding markers with custom icons to represent launch locations, each color-coded based on launch success rates. Circle markers were placed at landing sites with radii proportional to the number of successful landings, providing a visual representation of landing frequency. Lines connecting launch and landing sites illustrated typical flight paths, while popup information displayed detailed statistics including launch count, success rate, and payload information. These visual elements were chosen to provide an intuitive geographical understanding of SpaceX's operations, highlighting patterns in launch site performance and landing success across different locations.
