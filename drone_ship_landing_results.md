## Explanation

These boosters successfully landed on Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ships (ASDS) after launching payloads between 4,000 kg and 6,000 kg to orbit. Drone ship landings are typically used for missions with higher energy requirements, such as those going to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) or carrying heavier payloads to lower orbits.

The drone ships' ability to position themselves downrange from the launch site allows the booster to conserve fuel that would otherwise be needed to return all the way back to the launch site, enabling SpaceX to recover boosters from more demanding missions while still delivering heavier payloads to their intended orbits.
