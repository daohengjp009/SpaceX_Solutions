# Dashboard Visualization Summary

We developed an interactive Plotly Dash dashboard featuring a payload mass vs. landing success scatter plot to analyze the relationship between payload weight and mission outcomes, with hover interactions showing detailed mission information. Success rate bar charts for launch sites and orbit types were included to compare performance across different locations and mission profiles, with click interactions allowing users to filter data. A time series line chart tracked landing success rates over time, with zoom and pan capabilities for detailed trend analysis. These visualizations were chosen to provide comprehensive insights into the factors affecting landing success, enabling users to explore patterns and correlations through interactive data exploration.
