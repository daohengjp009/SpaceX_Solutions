## Explanation

This analysis calculated the total payload mass carried by SpaceX boosters for NASA missions. NASA is one of SpaceX's most important customers, primarily using Falcon 9 rockets for ISS resupply missions, crew transport, and various scientific satellites. The data shows that NASA typically launches from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and Cape Canaveral (CCAFS), with a wide range of payload masses depending on mission requirements. The total payload mass carried for NASA represents a significant portion of SpaceX's overall launch capacity, highlighting the important partnership between NASA and SpaceX in advancing space exploration and research.
