## Explanation

This query identified launches from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), showing both launch complexes used (SLC-40 and LC-40). Cape Canaveral is one of SpaceX's primary East Coast launch facilities, used mainly for missions to equatorial orbits, including ISS resupply missions and GTO satellite deployments. The results include flight numbers, dates, exact launch sites, payload masses, and success status (1 = successful landing, 0 = unsuccessful landing). These records highlight SpaceX's extensive use of CCAFS facilities for their Falcon 9 missions.
