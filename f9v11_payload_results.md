## Explanation

This analysis calculated the average payload mass carried by the Falcon 9 v1.1 booster version. The F9 v1.1 was SpaceX's first major upgrade to the Falcon 9, used between 2013-2015 for flights 6-20. Key improvements in the F9 v1.1 included stretched fuel tanks, upgraded Merlin 1D engines, and a new engine arrangement (octaweb), which increased payload capacity significantly compared to the original F9 v1.0. This version was an important step in SpaceX's development of reusable rocket technology, though it did not yet have the same payload capacity as later versions like the Falcon 9 Full Thrust and Block 5.
