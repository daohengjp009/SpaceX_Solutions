# Model Development Process Summary

We implemented and evaluated four classification models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Each model underwent hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV with 10-fold cross-validation to optimize performance. The SVM model with RBF kernel emerged as the best performer, achieving 85% accuracy, 83% precision, and 86% recall. Model improvement focused on feature engineering, handling class imbalance through stratified sampling, and optimizing hyperparameters. The final model selection was based on comprehensive evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix analysis, with the SVM model demonstrating superior performance in predicting both successful and failed landings.
